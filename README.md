# CorticalOCT
A finite difference time domain (FDTD) model for computation of A line scans in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) for active cortical regions. It is possible to simulate the end of the two arms (reference and sample) of the interferometer.
To obtain the interference signal the results from the two arms need to be post-processed.
The code has been built starting from <a href="https://github.com/john-b-schneider/uFDTD">john-b-schneider/uFDTD</a> and from <a href="https://github.com/FTroiani/2D-FDTD-OCT">FTroiani/2D-FDTD-OCT</a> .
